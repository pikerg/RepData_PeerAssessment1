It is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal movement
using activity monitoring devices such as a Fitbit, Nike Fuelband, or Jawbone
Up. These type of devices are part of the "quantified self" movement - a group
of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve
their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech
geeks. But these data remain under-utilized both because the raw data are hard
to obtain and there is a lack of statistical methods and software for
processing and interpreting the data.This assignment makes use of data from a
personal activity monitoring device. This device collects data at 5 minute
intervals through out the day. The data consists of two months of data from an
anonymous individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012
and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The data for this assignment are available from here
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip
       (save to your working directory)

The zip file contains one file: "activity.csv"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The variables included in this dataset are:

steps: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing values are coded
   as NA)

date: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format

interval: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken

The dataset is stored in a comma-separated-value (CSV) file and there are a
  total of 17,568 observations in this dataset.

Install requered packages
```{r}

Set file path to the "Source_Clasification_Code.rds"activities.csv file
```{r}
file <- "activity.csv"

Create data frame
```{r}
df <- data.frame(data)
```

Format Date
```{r}
df$date <- as.Date(df$date, "%F")

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Question 1:
##   What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
##    (ignore the missing values in the dataset)

##  1. Calculate the total number of steps taken per day.
##      aggregate default is to ignore NA
xSumPerDay <- aggregate(steps ~ date, df, sum)

##  2. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day.
ggplot(xSumPerDay, aes(date,steps)) +
  geom_histogram(stat='identity', fill='#3BB9FF', colour='black') +
  ggtitle('Total Number of Steps\nTaken per Day') +
  xlab('Date') +
  ylab('Number of Steps')
  
## 3. Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps
##      taken per day

paste("The Mean for Steps taken on all Days is", mean(xSumPerDay$steps, na.rm=TRUE))

paste("Median of Steps taken on all Days is", median(xSumPerDay$steps, na.rm=TRUE))
##-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
## Question 2:
##   What is the average daily activity pattern?

##  1. Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval
##    (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days
##    (y-axis)
xMeanPerInterval <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data=df, mean)

ggplot(xMeanPerInterval, aes(interval,steps)) +
  geom_line(colour='#FF0000') +
  ggtitle('Average Steps Taken Across All Days') +
  xlab('5 Minute Intervals of Day') +
  ylab('Number of Steps')

##  2. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset,
##    contains the maximum number of steps?
max_interval <- xMeanPerInterval$interval[which(
  xMeanPerInterval$steps == max(xMeanPerInterval$steps))]

paste("The interval with the max steps is", max_interval)

##-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Part 3:
##   Imputing missing values
##
##  1. Note that there are a number of days/intervals where there are missing
##    values (coded as NA). The presence of missing days may introduce bias into
##    some calculations or summaries of the data.
##    Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset
##    (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs)
sumMissing <- sum(is.na(df$steps))
paste("The sum of missing entries for steps is", sumMissing)

##  3. Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset.
##    The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use
##    the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.
##    Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the
##    missing data filled in.
df1 <- df

df1$id <- 1:nrow(df1)

dfMerge <- merge(df1, xMeanPerInterval, by="interval")

dfMerge <- dfMerge[order(dfMerge$id), ]

naIndex <- which(is.na(df1$steps))

df1[naIndex, 'steps'] <- dfMerge[naIndex, 'steps.y']

##--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
##returns the column value row that needs to be replaced
##df1$steps[which(is.na(df1$steps))]

##returns the row id than needs to be replaced
##which(is.na(df1$steps))

##determines whether value is na or not
##is.na(df1$steps)
##--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##  4. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate
##    and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. Do
##    these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the
##    assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates
##    of the total daily number of steps?
ggplot(df1, aes(date,steps)) +
  geom_histogram(stat='identity', fill='blue', colour='blue') +
  ggtitle('Total Number of Steps\nTaken Each Day') +
  xlab('Date') +
  ylab('Number of Steps')


##Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps
##      taken per day
xSumPerDay1 <- aggregate(steps ~ date, df1, sum)

paste("The Mean for Steps taken per Days is", mean(xSumPerDay1$steps, na.rm=TRUE))
paste("Median of Steps taken per Day is", median(xSumPerDay1$steps, na.rm=TRUE))

##-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Question 4:
##   Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
##
##  1. For this part the weekdays() function may be of some help here. Use the
##    dataset with the filled-in missing values for this part.
##    
##    Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels - "weekday"
##    and "weekend" indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
df1['dayOfWeek'] <- NA

for (i in 1:nrow(df1)) {
  if (weekdays(df1$date[i]) %in% c("Saturday","Sunday")) {
    df1$dayOfWeek[i] = "weekend"
  } else {
    df1$dayOfWeek[i] = "weekday"
  }
}

##  2. Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the
##    5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged
##    across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). See the README file in
##    the GitHub repository to see an example of what this plot should look like
##    using simulated data.
xMeanPerDayType <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + dayOfWeek, df1, mean)

ggplot(xMeanPerInterval, aes(interval, steps)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(dayOfWeek ~ .) +
  xlab("5 Minute Intervals")

ggplot(data = mydata) + 
  geom_bar(aes(myX)) + 
  facet_wrap(~myGroup)

qplot(interval, steps, data=xMeanPerInterval, facets = dayOfWeek ~ . )
